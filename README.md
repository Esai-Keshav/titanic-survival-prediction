# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Importing Libraries

In this project, we **import** crucial libraries to enhance data handling and visualization:

- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **seaborn**: Data visualization
- **matplotlib.pyplot**: Plotting and charts

## Loading Data

We **load data** from CSV files using **pandas**, differentiating between train and test datasets.

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Performing **EDA**, we:

- **Visualize distributions** of numerical features
- **Explore relationships** between variables

## Data Cleaning

In data cleaning, we:

- Address **missing values** appropriately
- **Drop irrelevant columns**
- Perform **feature engineering** for better model performance

## Model Testing

We **test ML models** like Decision Tree, LGBM, XGBoost, RandomForest, ExtraTrees, and Logistic Regression:

- Achieving **73.8% accuracy**, our chosen model excels.

## Test Submission

After selecting the best model, we predict survival on the test dataset and create a submission file.

## Conclusion

The **73.8% predictive accuracy** underscores the model's reliability. This project demonstrates the practical use of ML techniques on historical data, providing insights into Titanic survival factors.
