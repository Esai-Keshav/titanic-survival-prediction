# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning ✨🚢

## Importing Libraries 📚🔧

In this project, we start by importing necessary libraries, including pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot, to handle data manipulation and visualization.

## Loading Data 📊🔍

The dataset is loaded from CSV files using pandas. We have separate train and test datasets.

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 📈🔍

We perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data better. We visualize the distributions of numerical features and explore the relationship between different variables.

## Data Cleaning 🧹🔧

We handle missing values in the dataset, drop irrelevant columns, and perform feature engineering.

## Model Testing 🧪🚀

We test several machine learning models, including Decision Tree Classifier, LGBM Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, RandomForest Classifier, ExtraTrees Classifier, and Logistic Regression, to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The selected model achieved an accuracy of 73.8% 🎯🚀.

## Test Submission 📝✅

After selecting the best model, we use it to predict survival on the test dataset and create a submission file for evaluation.

## Conclusion 🏁📋

The model's accuracy is 73.8%, which indicates that it can predict Titanic survival with reasonable accuracy. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for predictive analysis on historical data, offering insights into the factors affecting survival rates during the Titanic disaster. 🚢💫
